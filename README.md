# Multivariate Analysis Covid-19

This project performs a descriptive analysis by exploiding the relationship between two independent but related databases regarding the behaviour of COVID-19. To get useful insights, we relate countries' healthcare key indicators with statistics of the COVID-19 in each country.

Thus, we first perform an agglomerative clustering analysis with medoids using PAM algorithm to observe the landscape, and a hierarchical clustering within each cluster to check the relationships among most similar countries. After that, we visualize the results using Factor Analysis and evaluate its significance.

Results can be clearly observed in the following figure
